# CYBERZOO
This Project was supported by IHUB DIVYA SAMPARK IIT ROORKEE   
Uttarakhand, a predominantly hilly state with forest-covered villages, boasts a substantial forest cover of 3.47 million ha, constituting 71% of its geographical area. This diverse region features various forest types and is home to a rich array of wildlife, including Bengal tigers, leopards, elephants, bears, and deer, posing potential threats to villagers. The "CyberZoo: Developing a Cyber-Physical Animal Tamer System" project aims to create an intelligent system to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.
